**Introduction**

This report is covering data mining practices and Machine Learning algorithms (further ML). Before diving deeper, let us clearify the terminology. At first is data mining, it is a process of discovering patterns, trends, and insigths from large data sets through different techniques such as ML and statystical analysis. Steps such as collecting, cleaning and analyzing is involved as well, and all this information is required to decision-making or prediction of the future actions or events (Stedman & Hughes, 2021). Therefore, ML is a subset of Artificial Intelegence that involves algorithms and statystical models that enable machines to learn and predict and decide without complicated programming. The main part of ML is training data, and the performance improves over time with experience (*What Is Machine Learning? | IBM* , n.d.). This report is covering ML models, such as kNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, RFC (Random Forest classifier), SVM (Support Vector Machine), Neural Network. Those will be described and explained in the following paragraph.
